        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I am interested in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems, especially those that exhibit unconventional superconductivity. My research explores the superconducting properties of high-temperature cuprates e.g. YBCO, recently discovered over-doped Ba2CuO3.25, and infinite layer nickelates, as well as heavy fermions like CeCu2Si2 and CeCoIn5.</p>

        <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed a new mechanism of superconductivity in heavy fermions and mixed-valence systems.</li>
            <li>My work on orbital dependence superconductivity in nickelates was validated by scanning tunnelling measurements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Collaborative Work</h2>
        <p>During my PhD, I worked in close collaboration with various experimental groups, focusing on transport and superconducting properties, e.g., in materials like graphene and PdTe2.</p>
